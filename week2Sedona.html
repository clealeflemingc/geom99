<h2>Sight Seeing</h2>
<!--Content Inspired From: https://visitsedona.com/spiritual-wellness/what-is-a-vortex/#:~:text=is%20a%20Vortex%3F-,What%20is%20a%20vortex%3F,seems%20especially%20alive%20with%20energy.-->
<p>Sedona has a lot to offer, but most notably is the presence of "vortexes" thought to be swirling centers of energy that are conductive to healing, meditation and self-exploration. Visitors travel from across the world to experience the cosmic forces that are said to radiate from the red-rock formations. While all of Sedona is a vortex, there are six locations where the healing forces are thought to be the strongest, with each radiating a different type of energy. Those who visit the vortexes to meditate and find healing often leave feeling inspired, uplifted, and recharged. Even if you are not a believer in comic forces, there is no doubt that you will feel connected to nature after visiting these picturesque sites.</p>
<p>In addition to the vortex locations, there are several other natural landmarks that are worth a mention. Devil's Bridge is a popular photo-op location famous for its large natural arching sandstone bridge. If you are looking for a place to cool off from the desert heat, West Fork Trail, Seven Sacred Pools, and Oak Creek Canyon all provide access to water for wading.</p>
<p>Sedona is surrounded by two State Parks, Slide Rock State Park to the north and Red Rock State Park to the south-west. The parks aim to preserve the natural landscape, provide education to visitors, and promote safe and environmentally friendly recreational opportunities. </p>
